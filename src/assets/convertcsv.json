   "What did you like about this course?": "This course was like an arts course and a comp course combined. If you like the thinking and problem solving side of computer science, the content is kinda like that but for solving a whole smorgasbord of problems in real life. The lecturer Richard Buckland is incredible, went to every lecture for the first time in over 2 years of uni. He is also committed to creating a collaborative and fun learning environment and takes feedback very seriously.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "There was SOOO much work to do. Also some of the actual hacking (extended students only) was pretty hard. Richard know about the workload and is trying to fix it for the next term. He even did a reflection session the term after to talk about it.",

   "Overall rating": "2 - ⭐⭐",
   "What did you like about this course?": "The wargames were a saving grace for this course. They were relevant, fun, and had a good community built around them.\n\nThe lectures were incredibly fun, and as always, Richard is a delight to listen to. The tutes were also really fun and my tutor (Jarrod) was an amazing tutor. The tutorial content, which while not always engaging directly with the week's material, always tied back to course content in some way well, helping me remember content.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "Everything else. The management for this course was a disaster, with stuff getting released super late. This course made me drop to 2 courses for the first time in my degree because I couldn't handle such a bizarre schedule. Time =/= other time. This was a point that Richard was aware of and seems keen to fix. Things that I dont like saying but should be said: I know that this course is \"extended\" - but there should be some workload cut for those in the extended stream. It's completely unmanageable. Not to mention that lots of the early excersises for the course felt useless (I personally don't have the same opinion of *what* was useless compared to the rest of the cohort. Some really hated stuff to do with civil engineering and whatever - to me, the most useless ones were the mini-tasks that were not supposed to take a whole lot of time. Having so many of those makes a massive \"task-switching\" cost that didn't amount to much. The bigger tasks are the most useful. \n\nThe communication to students in the beginning of the term was also poor. There were no announcements regarding what was due when and All that, but since they all got released late, this was important information. By the end of the subject, I was not bothered doing the maths for them and just finished it when I got to it. ",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "The worst of the pain points was that there was no forum. Since submissions (Which required no reaction from the admins) and questions (Which require reaction) were not separated, there is no way for you to raise concerns or to just ask questions about tangential things (e.g. something related to something awesome). This made me and the people I know have no chance to have a voice other than to make a stink and complain to stureps about everything.",
   "General comments": "In its current state, I can't recommend this course. The content here is great, and it's really the foundation of security. But you really can't expect someone to go through all of what I said (while maybe being a bit of a marks fiend, which I admit is a flaw of mine) and come up gaining anything but complete insanity. There seems to be a genuine push to improve these things, since Richard ran a \"how to make the course better\" session after the course was over. I hope it improves.",
   "Any similar courses you think people would enjoy if they liked this course?": "The rest of the security courses are well labeled I guess, any 64 course like 6447 or 6443 or others would be good candidates.",

   "What did you like about this course?": "Almost everything - if you're really into how programming languages are designed from a theoretical standpoint like I am, you'll enjoy it. This course is also one of the more mathy COMP courses, so I enjoyed that aspect of it too.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "The course isn't quite the same without Liam lecturing it anymore, but that's the only minor fault.",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "Can be quite mathematical, so if you're not a fan of the kind of maths you do in MATH1081, the first couple of weeks and the first test/assignment (whatever the first assessment is) might be a bit rough.\n\nHaskell knowledge is not assumed, but you'll either need to have prior knowledge from something like COMP3141 or be prepared to learn the language in your own time for the programming assignments. Haskell can be quite tricky to learn, especially on your own, so it's just something to be careful with.",
   "General comments": "This is an essential course if you’re interested in programming language theory, and especially if you’re planning to do a thesis in most areas within formal methods. Even if not, it’s made me consider doing some courses in the future that I originally hadn’t planned to, so I’d still recommend it highly if you're looking for something to do.",

   "Overall rating": "5 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
   "What did you like about this course?": "I'm a programming languages nut, and since compilers are a very important part of programming language design, this one was really interesting to me. Also gives you the opportunity to build a simple compiler on your own to the point where you can actually generate some executable code for programs, which is fun - it's very rewarding to have things work using a compiler you basically built from the ground up.\n\nAlso Jingling is a god at marking assignments fast - you'll never receive marks back for anything faster than when you do this course. He also provides insane feedback breakdowns (not individual obviously, but still good).",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "The starter code of the assignment definitely needs some updating and modernisation.",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "Some of the design choices in the starter code can be a bit inflexible or verbose if you want to do certain things, and you can't really change any of that, so be prepared to work around some of that out of necessity.",
   "General comments": "Not a terribly difficult course with a really responsive lecturer, so if you can get over the assignment code being a bit ugly, should be fun if you're into learning about compilers.",

   "What did you like about this course?": "Incredibly interesting content if you're interested in learning about the primitive models of computation that basically all of modern technology is based on. Also if stuff like the P = NP problem is interesting to you, this course has the most complete explanation of all of that and going well beyond to more general complexity theory.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "Not sure that this is entirely fair, but Paul was a bit slow to get marks out due to some personal issues he was dealing with. As a result, we were starved for feedback and revision/preparation material leading up to the final exam. We eventually got some stuff like a few days before the exam, but it definitely would've been more helpful",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "This course is very heavy on mathematics and proving stuff, so be warned that you probably won't enjoy this course if you hate MATH1081 type math. You might also struggle if you're rusty at it too, so definitely brush up a bit on proofs if it's been a while.\n\nAssignments are frequent and can be quite hard as well, so expect to spend a lot of time thinking. If you've done COMP3121 or COMP3821, it's very much like that. This obviously depends on the offering, but the exam can be quite lengthy and challenging too - for us it was a 24 hour take home.",
   "General comments": "A heavy course, but also a very rewarding one if you're really into the more theoretical side of CS. While I'm not sure everyone needs to take this exact course as it's kinda intense, I don't understand why CS students don't have to do something at least similar to this. It teaches you all about what computation actually means, and how computers work the way they do at a conceptual level and explores the limits of what we can hope to achieve in terms of solving problems. These are really important things to be aware of to fully appreciate what CS and programming as we know it have become.",

If I had done the extended version I would have been more exposed to more technical and practical concepts which might have been fun but I'm reviewing the regular version.

If you love problem solving, then hopefully you will like this course!. Despite the brain teaser questions being absolutely crushing on your brain and soul (it helped that i had a friend) they were very satisfying by the end, and if you don't get most of the questions, getting around 50% gets scaled to a 80%.

   "What didn't you like about this course?": "The lecturers were just researchers, so teaching wasn't their strong suit. In addition to this, marking was pretty hash in both assessments and exams, with little feedback. As stated in the pros, it was similar to discrete maths (i did 1081 after 4418), i find that I'm learning a lot of things twice, which is not very productive. I haven't found much of what i did in this course (besides the topics already covered in 1081, and the exposure to functional programming, granted i also got this in the prereq COMP3411), nothing has been very useful for my further studies",

The labs and quizzes are overall alright, and help sessions are very useful. One thing I really appreciated was the night before the assignment was due, I went to the help session that was meant to go from 6-8 pm but the tutors willingly stayed till around 10 pm to help students who were in the queue.

It really makes you apply everything that you learn immediately, so you end up being really confident in spinning up nice looking web pages.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "It was a hell of a lot of work.",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "The workload is pretty heavy if you want to do well, and completing the assignments is almost unrealistic unless you're already really confident with frontend.",
   "General comments": "I went into this course because I strongly disliked frontend, but I was encountering more situations where I wished I had the skills to even make a basic nice looking website eg. hackathons, personal website. So even if you're only interested in backend type stuff, I would still highly recommend this course because a solid foundation in frontend is just a really handy skill to have.",

   "What didn't you like about this course?": "Sometimes there was just a few too many “write a report” activities, and having to comment and screenshot those comments as proof got a little tedious. Also OpenLearning is a highly broken blogging platform.",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "When I took this course, there was a lot of complaints from students that the workload was way too heavy, and that they were spending way too much time on the weekly activities. But it’s important to realise that you don’t have to complete /all/ the activities. I probably did around 50-60% of the activities because that’s what I had time for and still managed to get >90 in the course. So if you do decide to take the course, it’s important to remember quality > quantity, and the workload won’t be too bad.\n\nThe course isn’t also particularly well organised and most of the time it feels like the tutors haven’t been told what’s going on either. But it really wasn’t a big deal - the content being taught was still good and tutors were pretty lenient if you didn’t get something done a particular week because the activities came out on Thursday instead of Monday.",

Content is primarily database modelling (drawing out DB diagrams), SQL (PostgreSQL specifically) and psycopg2 (using Python to work with SQL databases). There's a little bit of theory but it's a very practical course.\n\nThe content is very useful and the assessments were structured well and were fair in difficulty level (3 assignments of manageable difficulty, short weekly MCQ quizzes and a final). I also felt like I was learning something from all the assignments. There were a ton of extra resources as well (lots of tutorial questions to learn from which you can do in your own time, so you can pace yourself).\n\nDatabase schema is useful to learn for all developers and can also open the door for data analysis/business analyst roles so I highly recommend the course!",

   "Any pain points or things to note?": "Prolog is not a good time\n\nAlso if you already have a pretty good understanding of AI that you have done/researched in your own time, you might not get a lot out of it - I would recommend this course if you have 0 knowledge of AI (which was my case, and at the end I ended up appreciating AI :))",

   "Overall rating": "5 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
   "What did you like about this course?": "Personally I found the course very intuitive and easy to follow. In general if you find maths/problem solving easy or intuitive (e.g. you voluntarily attempted extra problem solving questions in high school maths), then you would probably find the course easy.",
   "What didn't you like about this course?": "I didn't learn any of the extension topics, due to a timetable clash, and the fact that I wasn't required to learn any of the extension topics was bittersweet",
   "Any pain points or things to note?": "In this particular year the extension part of the course was only assessed in one question in a midterm exam. Otherwise there was no real difference between the extended version of the course and the normal version. \n\nI found that most people either found the course really difficult or really easy.",
   "General comments": "I know it's now core for computer science, but it's an elective subject for software engineering. Also it was in semester 1 2018, before trimesters.",

   "General comments": "Compared to the 2018 offering the course cut out a lot of content, suddenly had the lectures recorded, and let us understand the content over a longer time period. I also heard that the previous years lecturer was fired during the semester it was offered. This may have been trimester related changes, but apparently our cohorts marks were considerably higher than the previous year. It would be wise to check how much the course has changed since 2019.

Course difficulty depends on how much frontend experience you have before hand and how much time you are willing to dedicate to the content. If you have no frontend experience, and can't commit all your time to study (which I assume would be most students), expect to be getting ~70% in assignments but be perfectly ok with that. ",
