If you like the thinking and problem solving side of computer science, the content is kinda like that but for solving a whole smorgasbord of problems in real life. The lecturer Richard Buckland is incredible, went to every lecture for the first time in over 2 years of uni. He is also committed to creating a collaborative and fun learning environment and takes feedback very seriously.",There was SOOO much work to do. Also some of the actual hacking (extended students only) was pretty hard. Richard know about the workload and is trying to fix it for the next term.

The lectures were incredibly fun, and as always, Richard is a delight to listen to. The tutes were also really fun and my tutor (Jarrod) was an amazing tutor. The tutorial content, which while not always engaging directly with the week's material, always tied back to course content in some way well, helping me remember content.","Everything else. The management for this course was a disaster, with stuff getting released super late. This course made me drop to 2 courses for the first time in my degree because I couldn't handle such a bizarre schedule. Time =/= other time. This was a point that Richard was aware of and seems keen to fix. Things that I dont like saying but should be said: I know that this course is ""extended"" - but there should be some workload cut for those in the extended stream. It's completely unmanageable. Not to mention that lots of the early excersises for the course felt useless (I personally don't have the same opinion of *what* was useless compared to the rest of the cohort. Some really hated stuff to do with civil engineering and whatever - to me, the most useless ones were the mini-tasks that were not supposed to take a whole lot of time. Having so many of those makes a massive ""task-switching"" cost that didn't amount to much. The bigger tasks are the most useful. 

The communication to students in the beginning of the term was also poor. There were no announcements regarding what was due when and All that, but since they all got released late, this was important information. By the end of the subject, I was not bothered doing the maths for them and just finished it when I got to it. ","The worst of the pain points was that there was no forum. Since submissions (Which required no reaction from the admins) and questions (Which require reaction) were not separated, there is no way for you to raise concerns or to just ask questions about tangential things (e.g. something related to something awesome). This made me and the people I know have no chance to have a voice other than to make a stink and complain to stureps about everything.","In its current state, I can't recommend this course. The content here is great, and it's really the foundation of security. But you really can't expect someone to go through all of what I said (while maybe being a bit of a marks fiend, which I admit is a flaw of mine) and come up gaining anything but complete insanity. There seems to be a genuine push to improve these things, since Richard ran a ""how to make the course better"" session after the course was over. I hope it improves.","The rest of the security courses are well labeled I guess, any 64 course like 6447 or 6443 or others would be good candidates.",,

This course is also one of the more mathy COMP courses, so I enjoyed that aspect of it too.","The course isn't quite the same without Liam lecturing it anymore, but that's the only minor fault.","Can be quite mathematical, so if you're not a fan of the kind of maths you do in MATH1081, the first couple of weeks and the first test/assignment (whatever the first assessment is) might be a bit rough.

Haskell knowledge is not assumed, but you'll either need to have prior knowledge from something like COMP3141 or be prepared to learn the language in your own time for the programming assignments. Haskell can be quite tricky to learn, especially on your own, so it's just something to be careful with.","This is an essential course if you’re interested in programming language theory, and especially if you’re planning to do a thesis in most areas within formal methods. Even if not, it’s made me consider doing some courses in the future that I originally hadn’t planned to, so I’d still recommend it highly if you're looking for something to do.","COMP3131, COMP3141, COMP3151, COMP4161",,

Also gives you the opportunity to build a simple compiler on your own to the point where you can actually generate some executable code for programs, which is fun - it's very rewarding to have things work using a compiler you basically built from the ground up.

Also Jingling is a god at marking assignments fast - you'll never receive marks back for anything faster than when you do this course. He also provides insane feedback breakdowns (not individual obviously, but still good).",The starter code of the assignment definitely needs some updating and modernisation.,"Some of the design choices in the starter code can be a bit inflexible or verbose if you want to do certain things, and you can't really change any of that, so be prepared to work around some of that out of necessity.","Not a terribly difficult course with a really responsive lecturer, so if you can get over the assignment code being a bit ugly, should be fun if you're into learning about compilers.","COMP3141, COMP3161",,

Also if stuff like the P = NP problem is interesting to you, this course has the most complete explanation of all of that and going well beyond to more general complexity theory.","Not sure that this is entirely fair, but Paul was a bit slow to get marks out due to some personal issues he was dealing with. As a result, we were starved for feedback and revision/preparation material leading up to the final exam. We eventually got some stuff like a few days before the exam, but it definitely would've been more helpful","This course is very heavy on mathematics and proving stuff, so be warned that you probably won't enjoy this course if you hate MATH1081 type math. You might also struggle if you're rusty at it too, so definitely brush up a bit on proofs if it's been a while.

Assignments are frequent and can be quite hard as well, so expect to spend a lot of time thinking. If you've done COMP3121 or COMP3821, it's very much like that. This obviously depends on the offering, but the exam can be quite lengthy and challenging too - for us it was a 24 hour take home.","A heavy course, but also a very rewarding one if you're really into the more theoretical side of CS. While I'm not sure everyone needs to take this exact course as it's kinda intense, I don't understand why CS students don't have to do something at least similar to this. It teaches you all about what computation actually means, and how computers work the way they do at a conceptual level and explores the limits of what we can hope to achieve in terms of solving problems. These are really important things to be aware of to fully appreciate what CS and programming as we know it have become.","COMP3161, COMP4121, COMP6721, COMP6741, COMP6752",,

This course is based around getting you to “think like an attacker”, so you become much better at spotting potential vulnerabilities wherever you go.
Other highlights were the extension component which involved learning basic CTF techniques, and the Something Awesome project, which was basically whatever personal project you wanted to work on over the term.","Sometimes there was just a few too many “write a report” activities, and having to comment and screenshot those comments as proof got a little tedious. Also OpenLearning is a highly broken blogging platform.","When I took this course, there was a lot of complaints from students that the workload was way too heavy, and that they were spending way too much time on the weekly activities. But it’s important to realise that you don’t have to complete /all/ the activities. I probably did around 50-60% of the activities because that’s what I had time for and still managed to get >90 in the course. So if you do decide to take the course, it’s important to remember quality > quantity, and the workload won’t be too bad.

The course isn’t also particularly well organised and most of the time it feels like the tutors haven’t been told what’s going on either. But it really wasn’t a big deal - the content being taught was still good and tutors were pretty lenient if you didn’t get something done a particular week because the activities came out on Thursday instead of Monday.",,"If you liked the extension activities, then COMP6447 and COMP6443 would be great!",,

The lecturer when I took it (John Shepherd) is amazing at teaching this course - even if you don't have him as a lecturer you should be able to have access to his slides as they are extremely helpful too. Content is primarily database modelling (drawing out DB diagrams), SQL (PostgreSQL specifically) and psycopg2 (using Python to work with SQL databases). There's a little bit of theory but it's a very practical course.

The content is very useful and the assessments were structured well and were fair in difficulty level (3 assignments of manageable difficulty, short weekly MCQ quizzes and a final). I also felt like I was learning something from all the assignments. There were a ton of extra resources as well (lots of tutorial questions to learn from which you can do in your own time, so you can pace yourself).

Database schema is useful to learn for all developers and can also open the door for data analysis/business analyst roles so I highly recommend the course!",The final exam took much longer than the estimated 3 hours (we were given 12 hours to do it but were told it was a ~3 hour exam),Setting up a Linux environment (look into WSL for Windows users) will make setting up PostgreSQL INFINTELY easier!,,,,

The lecturer (Claude Sammut) is quite good and explains base concepts well. Nice introduction to AI - does a good job in demystifying stereotypes of AI taking over the world. The content is also very easy to grasp compared to other electives and math is not really needed if that may be your weak point. ","Wish that a different language was used (Prolog was used but I wish Python was used with something like Tensorflow - this is taught in the higher level AI courses), wish there were less Prolog assignments. 

Wish there could have been more depth into the AI algorithms in the assignments (the assignments were either in Prolog or touched on very surface level AI theory).","Prolog is not a good time

Also if you already have a pretty good understanding of AI that you have done/researched in your own time, you might not get a lot out of it - I would recommend this course if you have 0 knowledge of AI (which was my case, and at the end I ended up appreciating AI :))",,,,

I recommend every CS student without any knowledge in Frontend or web dev to take this course if possible! Immensely useful knowledge and you will feel very comfortable in developing web apps once you finish this course :D Goes through LOTS of very useful content","The workload was crazy! 3 beefy assignments, decently beefy labs and definitely the most time constrained final I've taken (however the final is worth < 30% so hopefully you will have passed or are close to passing the course by then :))

However I've been told the labs were made optional in later terms after taking feedback on board from 2020T3 - I still highly recommend doing them, but perhaps just at your own pace :D",,"I highly recommend the course even if you dislike frontend dev (I was in this position), but this is also a very popular course so you will have to enrol quickly!",,,

Theory is quite useful and assessment structure is very manageable (weekly labs, 1 midterm, 1 assignment, 1 final). Tons of lecture slides and resources (e.g. homework questions)

Good intro to software/concepts that you encounter a fair bit in security as well (Wireshark, DNS)",Content is quite dry if you aren't a theory person,It's a theory based course but the midterm/final questions can't be regurgitated/copy pasted from a textbook. The questions are based on applying the theory to unseen scenarios (quite a few calculations too),"I found the course to be quite linear in terms of how much effort you put in will correspond to your final mark (study a lot = good mark, don't study = very likely to have a poor mark, study decently = grade is decent), so it's a fair course in that respect.

Midterm WILL be trickier than the assignment and the labs!

I found the course a bit bland as I'm not a theory person but I don't regret the course at all as it's very useful in System Design interviews (where you can talk about things like caching and DNS and general theory behind websites) and for your tech knowledge in general :) also very useful for Security related jobs.

You could learn some of the content outside of university yourself (textbooks, online resources etc) but if you need the motivation to go through textbooks and learn the content (like me xd) I recommend taking it as a course.",,,
